# GPX Converter for Pokemon GO

This web application allows you to convert a list of coordinates into a GPX file format.

## Usage

1. Open the GPX Converter in your web browser.
2. Enter the coordinates in the provided textarea. Each coordinate should be separated by a new line and in the format: latitude,longitude (37.795595333601256,-122.39341757928418).
3. Select the desired file format: GPX (for Android) or TXT (for iOS).
4. Click the "Download" button.
5. The converted GPX file will be downloaded to your device.

## Field Quests

Since [Velocity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pokemod.velocity&hl=en_US) can't handle links from a browser on Android 12 or higher, this tool can be used to copy-paste field quests from Pokedex100.

1. Copy-paste the entire field quest text into the Coordinates box.
2. Click the "Show Velocity" button.
3. Copy the generated output.
4. Paste the output into a private Discord channel.
